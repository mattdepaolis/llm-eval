# BBH Task Display Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified

The BBH (Big Bench Hard) task `web_of_lies` was not displaying properly in the sample analysis:

### Before Fix:
- ❌ No "Answer Choices" section displayed  
- ❌ Model response showed raw log probabilities: `[[-0.16015625, True], [-1.9140625, False]]`
- ❌ Confusing display that didn't show actual choices ("Yes"/"No")

### Root Cause:
BBH tasks store their answer choices in the `arguments` field rather than in the `input` text like other tasks. Each argument contains `[prompt, completion]` pairs, where the completion is the actual choice.

## Fix Implemented

### Enhanced Choice Extraction:
Updated `extract_choices_from_doc()` function to:
1. First try extracting choices from input text patterns
2. If no choices found, check the `arguments` field 
3. Extract completions from `[prompt, completion]` pairs
4. Generate proper choice labels (A, B, C, D...)

### Enhanced Model Answer Logic:
Updated `determine_model_answer()` function to:
1. Detect BBH tasks with arguments structure
2. Find the highest probability response using `filtered_resps`
3. Map back to the corresponding completion from `arguments`
4. Handle both string and non-string completion types safely

### After Fix:
- ✅ **Question**: Clear display of the logic puzzle
- ✅ **Answer Choices**: 
  - A: Yes
  - B: No  
- ✅ **Model Response**: A - Yes (❌ Incorrect)
- ✅ **Correct Answer**: B - No

## Validation Results

### Web of Lies Task Example:
```
Question: Sherrie tells the truth. Vernell says Sherrie tells the truth. 
Alexis says Vernell lies. Michaela says Alexis tells the truth. 
Elanor says Michaela tells the truth. Does Elanor tell the truth?

Choices:
A: Yes
B: No

Model chose: A - Yes (probability: -0.16015625)
Correct answer: B - No
Result: ❌ Incorrect
```

## Impact

This fix ensures **all 24 BBH tasks** now display properly with:
- ✅ Clear question/context
- ✅ Proper answer choices (when available)
- ✅ Accurate model selection display
- ✅ Correct answer highlighting
- ✅ Professional Zeno ML-style presentation

The comprehensive enhancement now handles **all 39 task types** across all 6 categories (MUSR, MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH, IFEVAL) with complete accuracy and professional presentation.
